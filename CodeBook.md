## Summary Choices
Only mean and standard deviations are kept. Values are averaged by variable, for every Subject and Position.

## Variables
Name                                                | Units | Type        | Description

Subject                                             |       | Factor      | Which subject was doing the action described by the row.
Position                                            |       | Factor      | Which position the subject was in during this row's observation.
